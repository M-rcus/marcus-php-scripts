# marcus-scripts

My personal scripts for random tools.

Some of these scripts are used via CLI, others are used via a webpage.

Public scripts are hosted at [marcus.pw/scripts](https://marcus.pw/scripts/).

## CLI scripts

### JavaScript / node.js

For `.js` scripts you'll need [node.js/npm](https://nodejs.org/)  
Run `npm install` in the project directory to install the required dependencies

### PHP

As of right now PHP scripts don't have dependencies (besides `php` itself).  
If they ever do, make sure to install [composer](https://getcomposer.org/) and run `composer install` in the project directory.  
If you're unsure: If there's a `composer.json` file in the project directory, get composer and run the command.
