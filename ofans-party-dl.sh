Downloads posts from creators on ofans.party

As of right now, the script downloads to the following directory:
    [output-directory]/[creator-name]/[post-id]_[date:YYYY-mm-dd]_[media-id].[filetype]

* Dates are according to the API, which is either "OnlyFans create date" (I assume that's when it was posted to OnlyFans)
  and just "create date", which I believe is when the post was added to ofans.party.
  - Because sometimes the "OnlyFans create date" can be missing and the "create date" is pretty unreliable,
    I've decided to use the post ID at the beginning of the file name, for sorting purposes.
  - I also have no idea if my theories are correct in any regard lol


If metadata is requested (\`-d\`), it will be written as a JSON dump under:
    [output-directory]/[creator-name]/metadata.json
Keep in mind that metadata.json will be overwritten every time you run the script for said creator.

OPTIONS:
    -p        How many \`NUM\` post downloads to run in parallel (default: 2).
    -o        Output directory. Default is: `pwd`/ofans
    -h        Show this message
    -d        Dump metadata for creator as JSON
