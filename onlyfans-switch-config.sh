# Bash script for swapping DIGITALCRIMINAL/OnlyFans configs
# so that I can easily change between "manual ripping" of profiles
# or automatic ripping which just runs continuously every 15 minutes.
# 
# For the script to work, you need to make a copy of the `config.json` file
# and configure it to be either the MANUAL or AUTOMATIC one.
# 
# If you make a copy that's named the same as $CONFIG_MANUAL, the script will assume that the
# current config is the one used for AUTOMATIC ripping.
# 
# The opposite occurs if you make a copy same as $CONFIG_AUTO,
# current config is considered the one used for MANUAL ripping.
# 
# TL;DR Make a copy that's either $CONFIG_MANUAL or $CONFIG_AUTO, not both.
# 
# The idea is that $CONFIG_AUTO can rip everything automatically by itself constantly.
# In my case that means:
# - `loop_timeout` is set to a sensible value (e.g. 900 = runs 15 minutes after last completed rip)
# - `auto_scrape_names` and `auto_scrape_apis` = true
# - `choose_auth` = false*
# 
# For $CONFIG_MANUAL it's basically the complete opposite:
# - `loop_timeout` = "0" or ""
# - `auto_scrape_names` and `auto_scrape_apis` = false
# - `choose_auth` = true*
# 
# * `choose_auth` assumes you have `extra_auth` = true
#    since it's meant for the times you have multiple accounts configured.
